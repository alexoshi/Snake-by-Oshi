Snake by Oshi 1.00-1 Sources

These are the sources for Snake by Oshi. They are pretty complicated and difficult to read, however I think they are still informative and show how the game is implemented. Many lines of code are copy and paste ones, I did not want everything to be automatic so that I was able to look for errors more easily.

The base files come from a MASM32 Windows Tutorial, the original game was called Space-Tris and showed how to the Windows API and DirectX. The Tutorial comes from Chris Hobbs and you can look at it on

To assemble the game you need MASM32 set up on the root of the drive the files are placed. You can also adjust build.bat to match your installation. The bmptosfp.exe program is a helper to convert the pictures to an easy format read by the program. It is not coded by me and there are no sources available.

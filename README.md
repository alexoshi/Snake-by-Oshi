A little DirectX game in MASM32 I learned programming with. It is based on a tutorial from Chris Hobbs, which can be found here with the original code from Space-Tris.

# Compiling
You need the MASM32 SDK setup on the same harddrive or adjust the build.bat 

http://masm32.masmcode.com/masm32/masm32v11r.zip

Just run the src/build.bat and it should compile

# Running
A functional version is in the export folder also containing a readme
